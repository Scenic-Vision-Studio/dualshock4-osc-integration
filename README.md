# Integrating DualShock4 with ChamSys for encoder control (using Chataigne and OSC)
In the fast-paced world of event lighting, innovation is the key to staying ahead of the curve. At Scenic Vision Studio, we are always pushing the boundaries to deliver extraordinary experiences for our clients. Recently, we embarked on an exciting project to integrate the DualShock 4 controller with ChamSys MagicQ for encoder control, through OSC and Chataigne, revolutionizing the way we manage lighting positioning and programming.

The DualShock 4 controller, originally designed for gaming, might seem like an unconventional choice for lighting control. However, its ergonomic design and precise analog sticks make it an ideal candidate for intuitive and responsive control of lighting parameters. By harnessing the power of OSC (Open Sound Control) and Chataigne, a versatile media control software, we were able to seamlessly integrate the controller into our lighting setup, opening up a world of creative possibilities.

One of the main challenges we faced was mapping the controller's inputs to the parameters in ChamSys MagicQ. We meticulously programmed custom OSC messages and Chataigne scripts to ensure that every button press and joystick movement on the DualShock 4 controller corresponded accurately to the desired lighting adjustments. Through extensive testing and refinement, we achieved a level of precision and control that surpassed our expectations.

The integration of the DualShock 4 controller with ChamSys MagicQ has revolutionized our workflow during live events. Now, our lighting operators can manipulate parameters such as color, intensity, and movement with unprecedented speed and fluidity, relying on this innovative control system.

Moreover, the intuitive nature of the DualShock 4 controller means that our technicians can focus more on the creative aspects of lighting design, rather than getting bogged down in complex technical operations. This streamlined workflow not only enhances our efficiency but also empowers us to push the boundaries of our creativity and deliver truly unforgettable experiences for our clients.

In conclusion, the integration of the DualShock 4 controller with ChamSys MagicQ represents a significant milestone in our ongoing quest for innovation at Scenic Vision Studio. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and our team's expertise, we continue to raise the bar in event lighting, setting new standards for creativity, control, and impact. Stay tuned as we explore further possibilities and push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of live event production.
